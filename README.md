## Description
Keep all DOM selections and DOM references organized in a single space. Avoid long and difficult-to-read select operations in your code by using simple and meaningful names instead.



## Methods
`DOM Selector` provides only 4 methods:
```js
  define    : 'Define a new selector'
, remember : 'Store a DOM reference that directly as last result without creating a selector.'
, run      : 'Run a selector'
, use      : 'Use the last result of the selector or remembered DOM reference'
```
